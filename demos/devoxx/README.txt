Sample Griffon application that relies on Devoxx's REST API.
This application showcases the following features:
- a custom WindowDisplayHandler (fades in the main frame)
- custom look & feel (JTattoo's Noire)
- use of icon sets (Crystal)
- query REST APIs using the REST plugin
- build tables and lists with Glazedlists
- apply custom cell renderers to tables

Griffon 0.9 is the minimal version required to run this application
however you can test it out without having Griffon installed, just
invoke the griffonw command with the appropriate target, for example
running the application is as simple as

    griffonw run-app

The application is not yet finished, it's missing some features I'd
like to show:
- a proper schedule layout

Enjoy!
